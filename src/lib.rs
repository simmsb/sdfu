//! # `sdfu` - Signed Distance Field Utilities
//!
//! This is a small crate designed to help when working with signed distance fields
//! in the context of computer graphics, especially ray-marching based renderers. Most
//! of what is here is based on [Inigo Quilez' excellent articles](http://www.iquilezles.org/www/index.htm).
//!
//! If you're using one of the more popular math libraries in Rust, then just enable the corresponding
//! feature (currently, [`ultraviolet`](https://github.com/termhn/ultraviolet), `nalgebra` and `vek`
//! are supported) and hopefully all the necessary traits are already implemented for you so that
//! you can just start passing in your `Vec3`s or whatever your lib calls them and you're off to the
//! races! If not, then you can implement the necessary traits in the `mathtypes` module and still use
//! this library with your own math lib.
//!
//! This crate is built around the central trait `SDF`. This trait is structured in a similar way to
//! how `std::iter::Iterator` works. Anything that implements `SDF` is able to return a distance from
//! a point to its distance field. SDFs can be combined, modified, and otherwise used for various tasks
//! by using the combinator methods on the `SDF` trait, or by directly using the structs that actually
//! implement those combinators.
//!
//! Most `SDF`s will be build up from one or more primitives being modified and combined together--the
//! distance fields in the `primitive` module provide good starting points for this.
//!
//! # Demo
//!
//! ![demo image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/termhn/sdfu/master/demo.png)
//!
//! The image above was rendered with my own path tracing renderer, [`rayn`](https://github.com/termhn/rayn),
//! by leveraging `sdfu`. The SDF that is rendered above was created with the following code:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature = "ultraviolet")]
//! # fn main() {
//! use sdfu::SDF;
//! use ultraviolet::Vec3;
//!
//! let sdf = sdfu::Sphere::new(0.45)
//!     .subtract(
//!         sdfu::Box::new(Vec3::new(0.25, 0.25, 1.5)))
//!     .union_smooth(
//!         sdfu::Sphere::new(0.3).translate(Vec3::new(0.3, 0.3, 0.0)),
//!         0.1)
//!     .union_smooth(
//!         sdfu::Sphere::new(0.3).translate(Vec3::new(-0.3, 0.3, 0.0)),
//!         0.1)
//!     .subtract(
//!         sdfu::Box::new(Vec3::new(0.125, 0.125, 1.5)).translate(Vec3::new(-0.3, 0.3, 0.0)))
//!     .subtract(
//!         sdfu::Box::new(Vec3::new(0.125, 0.125, 1.5)).translate(Vec3::new(0.3, 0.3, 0.0)))
//!     .subtract(
//!         sdfu::Box::new(Vec3::new(1.5, 0.1, 0.1)).translate(Vec3::new(0.0, 0.3, 0.0)))
//!     .subtract(
//!         sdfu::Box::new(Vec3::new(0.2, 2.0, 0.2)))
//!     .translate(Vec3::new(0.0, 0.0, -1.0));
//! # }
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "ultraviolet"))]
//! # fn main() {}
